# LuckyCSS* SassDoc Theme

This is LuckyCSS* SassDoc theme and is based on the [SassDoc's default theme](https://github.com/SassDoc/sassdoc-theme-default).

This theme uses [Themeleon](https://github.com/themeleon/themeleon) as a theme engine, and [themeleon-swig](https://github.com/themeleon/themeleon-swig) as a template engine, directly plugged into Themeleon.
